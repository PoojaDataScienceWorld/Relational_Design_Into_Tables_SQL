# Relational_Design_Into_Tables_SQL 
In this Project we will convert a relational design that enlists various users, their roles, user accounts and their status into different tables in SQL.
There are 5 tables in PROJECT_2 database.

Task to be performed:
● Define relations/attributes 
● Define primary keys 
● Create foreign keys


Following are the questions that we will deal with:
1. Insert data into each of the tables. With at least two rows in each of the tables. Make sure that you have created respective foreign keys.
2. Delete all the data from each of the tables.
